# Design System Layout Helpers
This package contains helper CSS to account for global layout and typography styles applied under the `.ds-page` wrapper.

## Developing / Contributing
Run `yarn install` and `grunt serve` to spin up a test file located in the test folder.

## Getting Started

### Install
You'll need both the JW Design Library & DS-Layout extension installed as dependencies via the [JW npm registry](https://npm-registry.longtailvideo.com/#/):

```shell
npm install @design/jw-design-library @design/ds-layout
```
or
```shell
yarn add @design/jw-design-library @design/ds-layout
```

### Import
Reference the following file in your Less to access the helper classes and mixins:
```less
@import (reference) "@design/ds-layout/dist/ds-page.less";
```

Alternatively, you can reference the minified CSS file at: `@design/ds-layout/dist/ds-page.min.css`.

**Note:**

In order for fonts to work properly, you'll need to include a link tag in your document head to pull in font families from the Hook CDN. For example:

```html
<link href="https://hook.jwplayer.com/jw-design-library/<version>/css/fonts.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Usage

### Page Wrapper
- Wrap all of your page content in a `<div>` with the class `.ds-page` (this should be your outer-most class for the entire page. This will help maintain consistent naming and correct style inheritance)
- To apply a pre-determined max width to your page, add the class `.ds-page--fixed`
- To remove all margins/padding and make your page full-bleed, add the class `.ds-page--full`
- To distinguish your page from others, add a class with the following syntax: `page--{name}`. You can then wrap all your page-specific Less in a tidy, readable file.

**For example:**

```html
<div class="ds-page ds-page--fixed page--home">
  ...
</div>
```

```less
.ds-page.page--home {
  // home-specific styles go here!
}
```

### Layout Helpers
- Apply `.ds-row` to any `<div>` that you'd like to automatically set `display: flex` on. Note this will automatically justify your content as `space-between`
- Apply `.ds-col` to any `<div>` that you'd like to automatically set to `display: flex` in a vertical column

**Want more control over flex behavior? There's a mixin for that!**
- Throw `.ds-flex()` onto any element in your Less to apply flexbox without having to write the syntax yourself
- This mixin accepts 3 arguments: @align, @justify, and @direction â€” all of which apply their normal browser default states (flex-start, flex-start, and row) unless otherwise specified.

**Examples:**

```less
.vertically-align-this-stuff {
  .ds-flex(@align: center);
}
```

```less
.column-with-all-content-at-the-end {
  .ds-flex(@justify: flex-end, @direction: column);
}
```

```less
.center-everything {
  .ds-flex(center, center);
}
```

### Typography
- Typography is largely handled for you when wrapped in `.ds-page`. No extra classes need to be applied! 
- Just use `<h1-h5>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<span>`, or `<small>` where you see fit, and the styles will handle themselves
- Unsure which tags to use? Check out our [typography test page](http://simi-dash.longtailvideo.com/sandbox/typography)
